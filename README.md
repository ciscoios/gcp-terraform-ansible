# iptcp-devops-labs
First lab was intended to become more familiar working with gcp, terraform, ansible.
Lab can be expanded by adding kubernetes, jenkins pipeline.

Future possible improvements
We can use this approach in the following way: 
1. build kubernetes cluster via terraform.
2. Use kubernetes provider and create a deployment with a jenkins service inside our k8s cluster.
3. Create a Jenkine Pipeline with a job to run terraform and all needed jobs.
4. Can we deploy our application via helm charts?!
