To make this terraform code work we should do the following:
1. add .terraformrc and placed it in ~username/.terraform.d/.terraformrc
with the content 
credentials "app.terraform.io" {
  token = ""
}
You can create token manually in terraform cloud -> User Settings->Tokens
or
create it by running "terraform login" command
Once created saved it and paste value into token parameter

Also run export TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE=~username/.terraform.d/.terraformrc

2. Create GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS variable in our terraform cloud workspace
(just paste json output in value section) 

Once added you should successfully initialize remote backend and create sample GKE cluster.
